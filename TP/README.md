# Algorithm selection

To run this python program open terminal and type `python run.py`.

When the menu shows up, press the corresponding number to the algorithm you want to use between the following :

| N° | Function |
| ------ | -------- |
| `1` | `PGCD` |
| `2` | `Inverse` |
| `3` | `Résolution equation modulaire` |
| `4` | `Théorème des restes chinois` |

More functions will be added later and used by the project.
